## Health Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| GitHub CLI | ✅ Pass | Authentication and configuration |
| Pre-commit Hooks | ✅ Pass | Code quality gates |
| Local Build | ✅ Pass | Build verification |
| Tests | ✅ Pass | Unit and integration tests |
| Linting | ✅ Pass | Code style compliance |

## Recommendations

- ⚠️ Success rate is below 80%. Review recent failures and improve test stability.
- ⚠️ Average pipeline duration exceeds 15 minutes. Consider optimization:
  - Enable parallel job execution
  - Improve caching strategy
  - Split large test suites

- ✅ Continue monitoring pipeline health regularly
- ✅ Keep dependencies up to date
- ✅ Maintain high test coverage
