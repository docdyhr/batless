## Major Changes Integrated

### 🏗️ Architectural Improvements
- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored monolithic 595-line `lib.rs` into 9 focused modules:
  - `config` - Configuration management with validation
  - `error` - Custom error types and result handling
  - `file_info` - File metadata and processing results
  - `formatter` - Output formatting for different modes
  - `highlighter` - Syntax highlighting functionality
  - `language` - Language detection and theme management
  - `processor` - Core file processing logic
  - `summarizer` - Code summary extraction
  - `tokenizer` - Token extraction for AI processing

### 🔧 Enhanced Features
- **Shell Completions**: Added support for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- **AI Profiles**: Predefined configurations for different AI assistants
- **Enhanced JSON Output**: Improved metadata and token extraction
- **Advanced Error Handling**: 11 specific error types with user-friendly messages
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Comprehensive suite with criterion v0.7

### 🧪 Testing Improvements
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 149 total tests
  - 110 unit tests across all modules
  - 33 integration tests for CLI behavior
  - 6 property-based tests for robustness
- **Quality Assurance**: Zero diagnostics errors/warnings

### 🔒 Security & Dependencies
- **Security Fixes**: Eliminated unmaintained `yaml-rust` dependency (RUSTSEC-2024-0320)
- **Updated Dependencies**: All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- **Vulnerability Resolution**: No known security vulnerabilities remaining

## Repository State

### ✅ Current Status

- **Version**: 0.1.5 (ready for release)
- **Working Directory**: Clean, no uncommitted changes
- **Remote Branches**: All stale branches removed from GitHub
- **Open Issues**: 0 (health check issue resolved)
- **Open PRs**: 0

### 📊 Quality Metrics
- **Diagnostics**: ✅ No errors or warnings
- **Tests**: ✅ 149/149 passing (100%)
- **Build**: ✅ Clean release build successful
- **Functionality**: ✅ All features working correctly
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Up-to-date and secure

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ All branches merged successfully with conflict resolution
2. ✅ Comprehensive test suite passes (unit + integration + property tests)
3. ✅ Zero diagnostics issues (errors/warnings)
4. ✅ Clean build in release mode
5. ✅ Shell completion generation working
6. ✅ All new features functional (AI profiles, JSON output, summary mode)
7. ✅ Security audit clean
8. ✅ Remote repository cleanup completed
9. ✅ Documentation updated

## Performance Impact

The modular refactoring introduced expected performance changes:
- **Positive**: Better maintainability, enhanced features, improved error handling
- **Trade-off**: Slight performance regression due to added functionality and safety checks
- **Baseline**: New performance benchmarks established for future optimization

## Next Steps Recommendations
