# Next Steps - batless Project

**Created:** October 20, 2025
**Your Role:** Sole developer and maintainer
**Current Status:** Phase 1 updates complete, PR #61 ready to merge

---

## ✅ **What You Just Accomplished**

1. ✅ Investigated and closed performance regression Issue #59 (false positive)
2. ✅ Closed bulk Dependabot PR #60 (prevented CI breakage)
3. ✅ Created comprehensive [GITHUB_ACTIONS_UPDATE_PLAN.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_UPDATE_PLAN.md)
4. ✅ Implemented Phase 1 updates (PR #61)
   - Updated 3 GitHub Actions dependencies safely
   - 32/38 CI checks passing (6 pre-existing failures)

---

## 🎯 **Immediate Actions (Right Now)**

### 1. Merge PR #61 ✅ **READY**

The PR is safe to merge:
- ✅ 32 critical checks passing (security, build, tests)
- ⚠️ 6 failures are pre-existing (not caused by your changes)
- ✅ All Phase 1 updates are low-risk

**Merge it:**
```bash
cd /Users/thomas/Programming/batless
gh pr merge 61 --squash --delete-branch
```

Or via web interface: https://github.com/docdyhr/batless/pull/61

---

### 2. Clean Up Local Files

You have some generated benchmark files that shouldn't be committed:

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "" >> .gitignore
echo "# Performance benchmarking files" >> .gitignore
echo "benchmark_baseline.json" >> .gitignore
echo "benchmark_baseline.txt" >> .gitignore
echo "benchmark_current.txt" >> .gitignore
echo "performance_summary.json" >> .gitignore
echo "performance_summary.md" >> .gitignore
echo ".perf_tmp/" >> .gitignore

# Commit the gitignore update
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: add benchmark files to .gitignore"
git push origin main
```

## 📅 **This Week (Optional, Low Priority)**

### Monitor Production
- Check that PR #61 merge didn't break anything (it won't - very safe)
- Watch for next Monday's automated performance check
- No action needed unless something fails

---

## 📅 **Next Week (Week of Oct 28 - Phase 2)**

### **Phase 2: Breaking Changes** ⚠️ Higher Risk

This is the important one - requires actual workflow changes.

#### **Priority 1: codecov-action v4 → v5**

**Status:** BREAKING CHANGES - Requires config updates

**What to do:**

1. **Review the breaking changes:**
   - `file` parameter → `files` (plural)
   - `plugin` parameter → `plugins` (plural)
   - New optional parameters available

2. **Find current usage:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "codecov-action" .github/workflows/
   ```

3. **Update configuration:**
   - Change `file:` to `files:`
   - Test in a new PR
   - Monitor coverage reporting after merge

**Time estimate:** 30-60 minutes

#### **Priority 2: codeql-action v3 → v4**

**Status:** Breaking changes in security scanning

**What to do:**

1. **Review current CodeQL setup:**
   ```bash
   batless -n .github/workflows/security.yml | grep -A10 "codeql"
   ```

2. **Check v4 migration guide:**
   - https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases

3. **Update and test in new PR**

**Time estimate:** 20-40 minutes

#### **Priority 3: cargo-deny-action v1 → v2**

**Status:** Major version bump

**What to do:**

1. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-deny@latest
   cargo deny check --all-features
   ```

2. **Update in workflow if local test passes**

**Time estimate:** 15-30 minutes

**Total Phase 2 Time:** ~2 hours

---

## 📅 **Week 3 (Week of Nov 4 - Phase 3)**

### **Phase 3: Remaining Updates**

Lower priority, can be deferred if needed.

#### **Priority 1: actions/setup-node v4 → v6**
- Only needed for markdown linting
- Safe but test the node version selection

#### **Priority 2: homebrew-bump-formula v3 → v5**
- Only affects Homebrew tap automation
- Test carefully but low user impact

**Total Phase 3 Time:** ~1 hour

---

## 🚫 **Pre-Existing CI Failures (Not Your Problem Right Now)**

These failures exist on main branch and aren't caused by your updates:

1. **Markdown Lint** - Minor formatting issues in docs
2. **Test (ubuntu-latest, beta)** - Beta Rust version test
3. **Code Quality Analysis** - Likely clippy pedantic warnings
4. **CI Status / CI Status Check** - Aggregate failures from above
5. **Sourcery review** - Third-party code review tool

**Recommendation:** Fix these later when you have time. They're not blocking releases or security.

---

## 🎯 **Long-Term Roadmap Reminder**

From your TODO.md:

### **v0.4.0 (Q1 2025)** - Next Major Release
- Tree-sitter integration for universal parsing
- AST analysis and extraction
- Performance optimizations

**When to start:** After completing Phase 2 & 3 updates (mid-November 2025)

## 🛠️ **Quick Reference Commands**

### **Check CI Status**
```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>
gh run list --limit 5
```

### **Create Phase 2 Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b ci/phase2-breaking-changes
# Make your updates
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "ci(deps): Phase 2 - Breaking changes (codecov v5, codeql v4, cargo-deny v2)"
git push -u origin ci/phase2-breaking-changes
gh pr create --title "ci(deps): Phase 2 - Breaking Changes Updates" --base main
```

### **Check Project Health**
```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy
cargo audit
./scripts/check_performance.sh
```

## 💡 **Tips for Solo Development**

### **Time Management**
- Phase 1: ✅ Done (nice work!)
- Phase 2: ~2 hours - do it next week
- Phase 3: ~1 hour - do it when convenient

### **Risk Management**
- Always create PRs, even as sole dev (CI validation)
- Test locally before pushing
- Merge quickly if CI passes (don't overthink it)

### **Don't Stress About:**
- Pre-existing CI failures (fix when you want)
- Dependabot noise (handle incrementally)
- Perfect test coverage (you have 188 tests - that's great!)

### **Do Focus On:**
- Security updates (already automated)
- Breaking dependency changes (your Phase 2/3 plan)
- New features when ready (v0.4.0)

## 🎉 **Celebrate Your Progress!**

You've accomplished a lot today:
- ✅ Comprehensive project status analysis

## 📞 **Questions for Yourself Later**

When planning v0.4.0:

1. **Tree-sitter Integration:**
   - Which languages are highest priority?
   - What AST features do users need most?
   - Performance targets for large files?

2. **Community Feedback:**
   - Review GitHub issues/discussions
   - Check crates.io download trends
   - Survey user needs on Discord/Reddit?

3. **Documentation:**
   - Are examples still accurate?
   - Need more use cases?
   - Video tutorial worth making?
