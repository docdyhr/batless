### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please use our feature request template and provide:

- A clear description of the feature
- The problem it solves
- Example usage
- Any alternatives you've considered

### Contributing Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- Git
- A terminal/shell

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/batless.git
   cd batless
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   cargo run -- --help
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests

# Run coverage (local)
cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace report

# Run quality subset
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo machete || true

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# Run with sample file
cargo run -- examples/demo.py --mode=highlight --max-lines=10
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure your code compiles without warnings
   - Run `cargo fmt` to format your code
   - Run `cargo clippy` and fix any issues
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

2. **PR Requirements:**
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Include a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass

3. **Review Process:**
   - At least one maintainer review is required
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep the PR up to date with the main branch

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/style-guide/)
- Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` and address all warnings
- Prefer explicit types when it improves readability
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use modules to organize related functionality
- Put tests in the same file as the code they test (for unit tests)
- Put integration tests in the `tests/` directory
- Document public APIs with rustdoc comments

### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for functions that can fail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use `?` operator for error propagation
- Don't use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in library code
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Performance

- Prefer streaming over loading entire files
- Use appropriate data structures
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Profile before optimizing
- Maintain memory efficiency

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test all public functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Use the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute for test modules

Example:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_process_file_basic() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test CLI functionality end-to-end
- Test different operating systems in CI
- Test various file types and edge cases
- Use temporary files for test data

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Run coverage reports locally when possible

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public functions and types
- Use rustdoc format (`///` or `/** */`)
- Include examples in documentation
- Explain complex algorithms or business logic

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes
- Keep documentation concise but complete

### API Documentation

```rust
/// Process a file according to the given configuration.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `file_path` - Path to the file to process
/// * `config` - Configuration for processing
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `FileInfo` containing processed data and metadata.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if the file cannot be read or processed.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let config = BatlessConfig::default();
/// let info = process_file("src/main.rs", &config)?;
/// ```
pub fn process_file(file_path: &str, config: &BatlessConfig) -> Result<FileInfo, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Issue Guidelines

### Bug Reports

- Use the bug report template
- Provide minimal reproduction steps
- Include environment details
- Attach relevant files if helpful

### Feature Requests

- Use the feature request template
- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Provide examples of how it would work
- Consider backwards compatibility

### Questions

- Check existing documentation first
- Use discussions for general questions
- Be specific about what you're trying to achieve

## Release Process

Releases follow semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Maintainer Release Steps

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create release PR
4. Tag release after merge
5. GitHub Actions handles the rest

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:

- CHANGELOG.md for significant contributions
- README.md contributors section
- Release notes for major features

## Getting Help

- Check the [README](README.md) first
- Look through existing [issues](https://github.com/your-username/batless/issues)
- Start a [discussion](https://github.com/your-username/batless/discussions)
