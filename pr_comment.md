## ‚úÖ CI/CD Fixes Applied

### Issues Resolved

1. **Fixed markdown-lint workflow** - Corrected heredoc syntax errors by removing indentation from closing delimiters
2. **Pinned all GitHub Actions** - All `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` actions now pinned to commit SHA `b3b07ba8b418998c39fb20f53e8b695cdcc8de1b` for security
3. **Fixed toolchain configuration** - Added missing `toolchain: stable` parameter required when using pinned SHA

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ **19 checks passing** (security, unit tests, compatibility, performance benchmarks, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **6 checks failing** (CI/CD workflow tests and code coverage)
  - Code coverage below threshold is expected per PR description
  - CI/CD test failures appear to be related to the broader technical debt resolution

### Security Improvements

- All third-party actions now pinned to specific commit SHAs (addresses Sourcery bot security feedback)
- Improved supply chain security posture for CI/CD workflows

The majority of critical workflows are now passing. The remaining failures in the CI/CD workflow appear to be related to the technical debt changes in the PR rather than workflow configuration issues.
