---

## 🎯 v0.2.4 – Performance Polish & Stability (Released)

Goal: Ship a tight polish release that hardens performance & safety signals before beginning v0.3.0 plugin architecture work.

### 📌 Release Outcome

Scope locked Aug 15, 2025; released same day after completing all scoped P0/P1 tasks.

### 🧩 Scope Delivered

Delivered deterministic performance guardrails, early fuzzing signal (allow-failure), doc/UX clarifications, and small ergonomic wins without expanding core feature surface.

### ✅ Delivered (v0.2.4)

- `--version-json` machine-readable build metadata
- Docker / musl build fixes
- Security & markdown lint gates integrated

### 🛑 Out-of-Scope (Deferred to v0.3.0+)

- Plugin system groundwork
- Tree-sitter / deep AST analysis
- New summary modes / complex analyzers

### 🧪 P0 (Shipped in 0.2.4)

1. Performance Regression Guard in CI
   - Integrate `scripts/check_performance.sh` (currently standalone) into workflow
   - Define thresholds (e.g. startup p95 < 10ms release build macOS CI runner; fail if > +25% vs saved baseline)
   - Store rolling baseline artifact (JSON) & allow manual reset via label or workflow dispatch
2. Nightly Fuzzing (allow-failure initially)
   - Add GitHub Actions job running `cargo fuzz run tokenizer -- -max_total_time=120` (or corpus time bound)
   - Upload crashes as artifacts; gate future promotion to required once stable
3. Document `--version-json`
   - README + `--help` examples; add schema snippet
4. Update Performance Claim
   - README: change "<50ms startup" → conservative "<5ms typical on modern hardware" with methodology link to `PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md`

### 🔼 P1 (Shipped – Ergonomic & Docs)

1. Architecture Overview Doc (outline module responsibilities + data flow)
2. Enhanced Logging Option (add `--debug-level=trace` alias / doc; reuse existing debug plumbing)
3. Wizard UX polish: show detected profiles count + last modified timestamp summary
4. Add `--output-format=json-pretty` convenience (pretty-print JSON mode only; noop in streaming)

### 🔽 P2 (Deferred)

- Structured logging backend evaluation (tracing) – doc spike only
- Supply chain: draft SLSA attestation plan (no implementation)

### 📊 Success Exit Criteria (Post-Release Tracking Status)

- CI perf job green 3 consecutive runs
- Fuzz job runs 5 nights with zero new crashes (or documented issues)
- README + docs updated (version-json, performance claim)
- No increase in open high-severity issues vs pre-0.2.4 baseline

### 🧪 Metrics Captured / Continuing

- Baseline JSON artifact: mean, p95, max startup times per mode
- Fuzz corpus size & execs/sec snapshot

### 🚧 Tracking (Final 0.2.4 Status)

- [✅] Perf guard workflow added
- [✅] Threshold config & baseline storage
- [✅] Nightly fuzz workflow
- [✅] Version JSON docs
- [✅] Performance claim updated
- [✅] Architecture doc (outline)
- [✅] Wizard UX polish
- [✅] Pretty JSON flag
- [✅] Release notes drafted (`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE_0.2.4.md`)

### 🧭 Post-Release Follow-Up (v0.2.4)

1. Stabilize performance baseline (achieve 3 consecutive green runs)
2. Begin v0.3.0 plugin architecture design doc
3. Evaluate structured logging backend (spike)
4. Draft SLSA attestation plan (supply chain)
5. Collect early community feedback on JSON ergonomics
