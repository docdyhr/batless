# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-09

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed syntax highlighting** (`--mode=highlight`, `--theme`, `--list-themes`, `--configure`, `--list-profiles`, `--edit-profile`): batless is now positioned as a pure AI-native structured output tool. The syntect dependency has been dropped entirely, reducing binary size and eliminating the transitive dependency chain. Use `bat` for interactive terminal highlighting.
- **Default output mode changed**: `plain` is now the default (was `highlight`). This is more predictable in scripts and pipelines.

### 🎯 Major Features

- **🌳 AST Mode (`--mode=ast`)**: Emits the raw tree-sitter parse tree as pretty-printed JSON
  - Output shape: `{file, language, mode, parser, total_lines, total_bytes, root: {type, start, end, children|text}}`
  - Supported: Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX
  - Unsupported languages: `"parser": "none", "root": null`
  - Leaf nodes include `text` (≤256 chars); max recursion depth 64
- **📁 Multi-file Index Mode**: `batless --mode=index <dir>` walks directories, emitting one compact NDJSON line per file
  - Hidden directories skipped automatically
  - Files processed in sorted order for deterministic output
  - Per-file errors emitted as `{"file":"...","error":"..."}` keeping the stream valid

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Formatter trait consolidation**: Plain, Json, Summary, Index, and Ast modes all implement the `Formatter` trait in `src/formatters/`. `formatter.rs` is now a thin dispatcher.
- **Removed**: `src/highlighter.rs`, `src/wizard.rs`, `ThemeManager`, `OutputMode::Highlight`
- **Dependencies removed**: `syntect 5`, `strip-ansi-escapes 0.2`

### Testing

- **365 total tests** (lib: 225, integration: 140), zero failures

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### 🎯 Major Features

- **🗂️ Symbol Index Mode (`--mode=index`)**: New output mode producing a machine-readable JSON symbol table
  - Output shape: `{file, language, symbol_count, symbols: [{kind, name, line_start, line_end, signature, visibility}]}`
  - AST-backed for Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript; regex fallback for all other languages
  - Designed for AI consumers that need precise, navigable code structure without reading full file content
- **🌊 Semantic Chunking (`--chunk-strategy=semantic`)**: Streaming chunks now respect declaration boundaries
  - Uses tree-sitter to extend each chunk to the next top-level declaration boundary (Rust/Python/JS/TS)
  - Line-based fallback for languages without tree-sitter grammar support
  - New `src/chunker.rs` module with `SemanticBoundaryFinder` abstraction
- **✂️ Content Stripping Flags**: Two new flags for AI-optimized, compressed output
  - `--strip-comments` — removes comment-only lines; language-aware (`//`, `#`, `--`, `%`, `;`, C block comments)
  - `--strip-blank-lines` — removes blank/whitespace-only lines
  - `compression_ratio` field added to JSON output (original_line_count / stripped_line_count)
- **🔢 Structured Summary Items**: Summary lines now carry precise location metadata for AI consumers
  - New `SummaryItem` struct with `line_number`, `end_line`, and `kind` fields
  - Enables AI tools to jump directly to the exact source location of any summarized symbol
- **🏷️ Line-Numbered JSON Lines (`--with-line-numbers`)**: JSON `lines` array entries become `{"n": 1, "text": "..."}` objects instead of plain strings
- **#️⃣ Content Hash (`--hash`)**: SHA-256 file hash included in JSON output for robust change detection and cache invalidation

### 🚀 Improvements

- **📊 LLM Token Estimates in JSON**: `estimated_llm_tokens` and `token_model` fields added to JSON output when a profile or `--ai-model` flag is active
- **🤖 Expanded AI Profile Limits**: `--profile=claude` max-lines raised from 4,000 → 20,000 with `SummaryLevel::Standard`; new `--profile=claude-max` supports up to 150,000 lines with JSON output and no summary overhead
- **📡 Pure NDJSON Streaming**: Streaming mode no longer inserts `---` separators between chunks — output is now valid NDJSON (one compact JSON object per newline), enabling direct use with `jq` and streaming parsers
- **🔖 Renamed JSON Fields for Clarity**: `tokens` → `identifiers`, `token_total` → `identifier_total` in JSON output; `--include-tokens` kept as a deprecated alias for `--include-identifiers`
- **📐 Serialized Missing JSON Fields**: `total_lines_exact` and `identifier_total` were previously computed but not emitted in JSON output — both are now always serialized

### Bug Fixes

- **TypeScript AST**: Fixed decorator-aware class line detection so classes preceded by decorators (`@Component`, `@Injectable`, etc.) report the correct `line_number` for the `class` keyword rather than the decorator line

### Testing

- **404 total tests** (up from 386 in v0.4.1, +18 tests)
  - 9 new integration tests covering `--mode=index`, `--chunk-strategy=semantic`, `--strip-comments`, and `--strip-blank-lines`
  - 9 new unit tests for `SemanticBoundaryFinder`, `SummaryItem` struct, and compression ratio calculation
- Zero clippy warnings, zero test failures

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-27

### Bug Fixes

- **Panic elimination**: Replaced 4 `unwrap()` calls in `ast_summarizer.rs` with proper error handling, preventing panics on malformed AST queries
- **Panic elimination**: Replaced 4 `unwrap()` calls in `wizard.rs` with safe alternatives
- **Cast safety**: Fixed `u64` to `usize` cast in `processor.rs` with saturating conversion to prevent truncation on 32-bit platforms
- **Test reliability**: Changed integration tests to use `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_batless")` instead of `cargo run`, fixing intermittent macOS CI failures

### Improvements

- **AST summarizer wired into pipeline**: The tree-sitter `AstSummarizer` is now fully integrated into the summary mode processing pipeline, replacing the regex-based fallback when tree-sitter grammars are available
- **Error handling**: Improved error types with more specific variants and contextual help messages
- **Levenshtein optimization**: Switched from full-matrix to two-row algorithm for fuzzy matching in error suggestions, reducing memory from O(n*m) to O(m)
- **Config refactor**: Extracted validation logic from `config.rs` (1,120 lines) into dedicated `config_validation.rs` (376 lines) for better separation of concerns

### CI/CD

- Removed 8 deprecated workflows, consolidating from 19 to 11 workflows
- Reduced scheduled workflow frequency (security: daily to weekly, health-check/fuzz: daily to weekly)
- Added concurrency controls to prevent redundant parallel runs
- Fixed cross-platform-validation workflow parse errors caused by `matrix.shell` in non-triggered workflow validation

### Dependencies

- Updated 66+ compatible dependencies including:
  - clap 4.5.58 → 4.5.60, tree-sitter 0.26.5 → 0.26.6
  - regex 1.12.2 → 1.12.3, libc 0.2.177 → 0.2.182
  - proptest 1.9.0 → 1.10.0, tempfile 3.24.0 → 3.26.0

### Testing

  - 35 new tests for `config_manager.rs`
  - 16 new tests for `ast_summarizer.rs`
  - 18 validation tests in new `config_validation.rs`
- Zero clippy warnings, zero test failures
