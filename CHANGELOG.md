- Clean, predictable output format
- JSON mode for structured data extraction
- Safe defaults for automated workflows
- No decorations or interactive elements

### Features for CI/CD
- Guaranteed streaming output
- Configurable color control for different environments

### Comparison with `bat`
- ‚úÖ Never blocks (unlike `bat` which can use `less`)
- ‚úÖ JSON output mode (not available in `bat`)
- ‚úÖ Byte limiting support (not in `bat`)
- ‚úÖ AI/automation focused design
- ‚ùå No Git integration (by design)
- ‚ùå No line numbers (by design for clean output)
- ‚ùå No file headers (by design for minimal output)
